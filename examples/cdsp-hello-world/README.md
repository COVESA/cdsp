# Central Data Service Playground Hello World

> [!NOTE]
> Apologies. As you can see the team has been busy adding features and not got around to finishing this example yet. In the meantime, please take a look at the deployment section of the [Docker README.md](https://github.com/COVESA/cdsp/blob/main/docker/README.md#deploy-with-docker-compose) which gives guidance on starting the Playground and sanity testing it is running correctly.

This is a simple "hello-world" example for the Central Data Service Playground (CDSP).

Goals:
1. Act as a sanity test that the Playground is running correctly
2. Provide a simplistic example of VSS and VISS use in the Playground.

## Logical/Implementation Concept
This example does not expand the concept of the Playground. Therefore please see the Playground documentation for a description of the Logical and Implementation concepts behind it.
