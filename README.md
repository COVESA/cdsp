# Central Data Service Playground (CDSP)
The Central Data Service Playground (CDSP) is a neutral, open playground for data services both within and outside the vehicle in the context of data-centric architectures. It enables investigation into the internals of these services and how they can be combined. Furthermore, the playground provides a means to publish and collaborate on such work in the open.

For further information please see the 
<a href="https://covesa.github.io/cdsp/">CDSP documentation</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> CDSP is a young project and there are some gaps to fill here and there in project setup and more comprehensive documentation. Please bear with us as we do that. That said you should find the actual code works. Please ask questions on chat or join the COVESA Data Architecture team call.

## Getting started
A good place to start is the overview in the documentation which introduces why the project exists, the logical concept and its implementation.

Once you are ready to jump into some code the docker deployment readme explains building and starting the playground. Whilst the hello-world example provides simple examples of accessing the data store directly and using the data server to get/set data using the [Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS)](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification) API. Hello-world can also be used as a sanity test that the playground is operating as expected.

## Known issues
