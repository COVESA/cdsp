# Knowledge Layer - WebSocket Client

This project contains a WebSocket client built in C++17, which communicates with a WebSocket server. The client can send and receive JSON messages using Boost libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- **Boost** (version 1.86.0 or higher)
- **g++/clang++** with C++17 support
- **Homebrew** (for macOS users)
- A WebSocket server to connect to, see how to start the **information-layer** Websocket server [here](../information-layer/README.md)
  
### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Boost (macOS/Linux)**:
   If you're on macOS, you can install Boost using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install boost
   ```

   For Linux, you can install Boost using your package manager, or build from source:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   ```

2. **Install CMake**:
   Ensure you have CMake installed:

   ```bash
   brew install cmake  # For macOS
   sudo apt-get install cmake  # For Linux
   ```

## Project Setup

**Build the WebSocket Client**:

   The WebSocket client is located in the `connector/websocket-client/` directory. To build it from this directory:

   ```bash
   # Create a build directory
   mkdir -p build
   cd build

   # Run CMake to generate build files
   cmake ..

   # Build the project
   make
   ```

   If the build is successful, the WebSocket client executable will be generated in the `build/bin/` directory.

## Running the WebSocket Client

### Environment Variables

The project expects two environment variables for the WebSocket serverâ€™s host and port. By default, the websocket client uses the `information-layer` (host: localhost, port: 8080). See how to configure them [here](../information-layer/README.md). You can use a custom websocket server configuration adding the following ENV variables in `/docker/.env` file:

```text
##################################
# WEBSOCKET-SERVER CONFIGURATION #
##################################
HOST_WEBSOCKET_SERVER="your_custom_host"
PORT_WEBSOCKET_SERVER="your_custom_port"
```

### Start the Websocket Client
After successfully building the client, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
./build/bin/websocket_client
```
