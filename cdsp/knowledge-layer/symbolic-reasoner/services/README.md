# Services Module

The Services Module is a core component of the Knowledge Layer application, responsible for managing interactions with reasoning engines and facilitating rule-based reasoning within the system. This module primarily consists of the ReasonerService and ReasonerFactory classes, which abstract the complexities of connecting to and utilizing different inference engines.

## Key Components

### ReasonerService
   
This is an interface between the application and the underlying reasoner adapter. It provides methods to:
- Initialize the Adapter: Establishes a connection to the selected reasoning engine.
- Data Management: Load data and rules into the reasoner.
- Querying: Execute queries on the data store.
- Cleanup: Delete the data store when necessary.
   
###  The ReasonerFactory 

It is responsible for creating and initializing a ReasonerService with the appropriate reasoning engine (e.g., RDFox). It provides a seamless way to instantiate services with the required configurations.
