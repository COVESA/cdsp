# Handlers

We support two different databases. For each of them is required to configure the corresponding ENV variables in `/docker/.env` file. 

- [IotDB](./src/iotdb/README.md)
- [RealmDB](./src/realmdb/README.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Before start working with any of them, ensure that the supported data points are correctly defined and configured. See [how](./handlers/config/README.md).

See [here](../../information-layer/README.md) how to install and start the Websocket-Server.
