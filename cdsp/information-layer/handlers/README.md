# Handlers

We support two different databases. 

- [IotDB](./src/iotdb)
- [RealmDB](./src/realmdb)

> [!WARNING]
> Before start working with any of them, ensure that the supported endpoints are correctly defined and configured. See [how](./handlers/config/README.md).

See [hier](../../information-layer/router/README.md) how to install the Database-Router.
