## Introduction
The playground uses the [VISSR](https://github.com/COVESA/vissr) project to provide its northbound VISS support, along with the other features it provides.

The VISSR project [documentation site](https://covesa.github.io/vissr/) has extensive documentation on the VISSR components. So as the project progresses we will add information below focused on topics specific to the playground.

## Apache IoTDB connector
Please see the [IoTDB guide]({{< ref "apache-iotdb" >}} "Apache IoTDB Guide") for details of the connector between VISSR and IoTDB.
