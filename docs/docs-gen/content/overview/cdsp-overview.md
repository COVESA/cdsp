The Central Data Service Playground (CDSP) serves as a neutral, open playground for data services both within and outside the vehicle in the context of data-centric architectures. It enables investigation into the internals of these services and how they can be combined. Furthermore, the playground provides a means to publish and collaborate on such work in the open.

The playground was first conceived by the COVESA Data Architecture team to meet their needs. They also recognized that there were the same needs in the wider community inside and outside COVESA. For example, to demonstrate how VSS data can be used with its eco-system for newcomers.
